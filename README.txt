This program uses Binary Trees to implement an expression Tree using the prefix form.
The program takes 2 params:
	- the input file name
	- the output file name
The program evaluates a number of n prefix expressions, generating an Expression Tree
for each of them, and displays the result of the expression, or the error generated
when trying to solve the ectuation.
The operators you may use:
	- '-' 
	- '+'
	- '*'
	- '/'
	- '^'
	- 'sqrt'
The expressions contain variables and operands. 
The input file may look like following:
[n] - number of variables
[var1 = val1] 
.
.
[varn = valn]
[m] - number of expressions
[expr1]
.
.
[exprm]
